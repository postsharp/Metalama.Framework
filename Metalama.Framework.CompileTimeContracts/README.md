# Metalama.Framework.TemplateContracts

This assembly exposes the public API of Metalama to the _transformed_ compile-time user code created with `Metalama.Framework` (e.g. to the compiled code templates).

## Backward Compatibility Promise

All public APIs are guaranteed to be backward compatible within the current major version.

The promise does not apply to any preview build of this package.
