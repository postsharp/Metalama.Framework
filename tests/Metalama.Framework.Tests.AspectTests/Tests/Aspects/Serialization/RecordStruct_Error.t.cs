// CompileTimeAspectPipeline.ExecuteAsync failed.
// Error LAMA0210 on `TargetStruct`: `Cannot generate a compile-time serializer for 'TargetStruct' because generated serializers are not currently supported for a positional record class or struct. You can provide a manual serializer (public nested class) derived from ReferenceTypeSerializer (record classes) or ValueTypeSerializer (record structs) instead.`
