// Error LAMA0108 on `i`: `Cannot set the compile-time variable 'i' here because it is part of a block whose execution depends on the run-time condition 'if ( meta.Target.Parameters.Single().Value > 0 )' and it was not declared inside the block. Move the assignment out of the run-time-conditional block or move the variable into the block.`
