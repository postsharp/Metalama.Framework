The `Metalama.Testing.AspectTesting` is a test framework that you can use to test aspects and fabrics and that integrate with all test runners supporting xUnit.

This is not your typical test framework. When referencing this package, every _file_ is turned into a test by default. 

Please read the documentation before use: https://doc.metalama.net/aspects/testing/compile-time-testing.
