The `Metalama.Framework.Engine` package contains the implementation of `Metalama.Framework`. 

It is required by `Metalama.Framework.Introspection` and `Metalama.Testing.AspectTesting` but you should normally never reference it directly in your projects.

## Backward Compatibility Promise

**NONE**. This package does not come with any backward compatibility guarantee.

Everything, even public members, should be considered as an implementation detail.
