The `Metalama.Framework.Engine` package contains the implementation of `Metalama.Framework`. 

It is required by `Metalama.Framework.Introspection` and `Metalama.Testing.`AspectTesting`, but you should normally never reference it directly in your projects.

** All APIs in this package are considered implementation details and are subject to change without notice. **
