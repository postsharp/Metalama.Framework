The `Metalama.Framework.Engine` package contains the implementation of `Metalama.Framework`. 

It is required by `Metalama.Framework.Introspection` and `Metalama.TestFramework` but you should normally never reference it directly in your projects.

It should be considered as an implementation detail. Its public API can change without notice and backward compatibility is not honored.
