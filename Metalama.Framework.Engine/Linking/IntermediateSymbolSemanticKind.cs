    ///  3) Aspect-overridden source member that does not hide or override a base member.

    ///  5) Aspect-introduced member that does not hide or override a base member, no aspect overrides.
    ///  6) Aspect-introduced member hiding a base member, no aspect overrides.
    ///  7) Aspect-introduced and aspect-overriden member that does not hide or override a base member.
    ///  8) Aspect-introduced and aspect-overriden member hiding or overriding a base member.
    ///  
    /// 7) and 8) are possible only for fields and event fields. All introduced declarations with bodies have at least one aspect override.
