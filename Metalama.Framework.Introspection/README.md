The `Metalama.Framework.Instrospection` package allows you to look at and introspect resulting transformations created by Metalama aspects. 

For documentation, see https://doc.metalama.net/introspection-api.

This package should not be referenced directly in user projects. To use Metalama introspection in your code, you probably need to reference `Metalama.Framework.Workspaces`.
