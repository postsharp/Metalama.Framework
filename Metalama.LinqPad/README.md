The `Metalama.LinqPad` package allows you to load any C# project or solution into LINQPad and exposes its code model to queries. This package contains an optional driver, samples, and dumping methods.

For documentation, see https://doc.metalama.net/introspection-api.

If you want to do code queries in your own projects instead of LinqPad, use the `Metalama.Framework.Workspaces` package.

## Backward Compatibility Promise

All public APIs are guaranteed to be backward compatible within the current major version.

The promise does not apply to any preview build of this package.
